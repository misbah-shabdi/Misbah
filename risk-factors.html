            <h2>Causes</h2>
            <p>Tuberculosis (TB) is caused by a bacterium called Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
                People with active TB disease in the lungs or voice box can spread the disease. They release tiny
                droplets that
                carry the bacteria through the air. This can happen when they're speaking, singing, laughing, coughing
                or
                sneezing. A person can get an infection after inhaling the droplets
            </p>
        </section>
        <section class="symptoms section-margins">
            <h2>Symptoms of active TB disease</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>A cough that lasts three weeks or longer</li>
                <li>Chest pain</li>
                <li>Coughing up blood or sputum (phlegm from deep inside the lungs)</li>
                <li>Weakness or fatigue</li>
                <li>Weight loss</li>
                <li>Loss of appetite</li>
                <li>Chills</li>
                <li>Fever</li>
                <li>Night sweats</li>
            </ul>
            <p>People with inactive TB do not have symptoms. However, without treatment, they can develop active TB
                disease and
                become sick.</p>

            <h2>How it spreads</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>TB is spread through the air from one person to another. The TB germs are put into the air when a
                    person
                    with active TB disease of the lungs or throat coughs, speaks, or sings.</li>
                <li>These germs can stay in the air for several hours, depending on the environment. TB germs are more
                    likely to
                    spread in indoor areas or other places with poor air circulation (such as a closed vehicle) than in
                    outdoor
                    areas. People who breathe in the air become infected with TB.</li>
                <li>People with active TB disease are most likely to spread TB germs to people they spend time with
                    every day.
                </li>

        <section class="risk section-margins">
            <h2>Risk Factors</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Anyone can get tuberculosis (TB), but some people are at higher risk than others.</li>
                <li>You can get TB even if you received the TB vaccine (also known as bacille Calmette-Gu√©rin or BCG
                    vaccine).
                </li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section class="risk-increase section-margins">
            <h2>Conditions that can increase risk</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Some people with weakened immune systems (due to certain medications or health conditions) are at
                    very high
                    risk of developing active TB disease once infected with TB germs. It is very important that these
                    people
                    receive treatment for inactive TB to prevent the development of active TB disease.</li>
                <li>HIV infection</li>
                <li>Substance use (such as injection drug use)</li>
                <li>Specialized treatment for rheumatoid arthritis or Crohn's disease</li>
                <li>Organ transplants</li>
                <li>Severe kidney disease</li>
                <li>Head and neck cancer</li>
                <li>Diabetes</li>
                <li>Silicosis</li>
                <li>Low body weight</li>
                <p>Babies and young children often have weak immune systems. Children, especially those under age five,
                    have a
                    higher risk of developing TB disease once infected with TB germs.
