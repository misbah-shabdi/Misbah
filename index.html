					<li>“Every year, 10 million people fall ill with tuberculosis (TB)”. Despite being a preventable and curable disease, 1.5 million people die from TB each year – making it the world’s top infectious killer."</li>
					<li><strong>TB is the leading cause of death of people with HIV and also a major contributor to antimicrobial resistance.</strong> Most of the people who fall ill with TB live in low- and middle-income countries, but TB is present all over the world. About half of all people with TB can be found in 8 countries: [Bangladesh, China, India, Indonesia, Nigeria, Pakistan, Philippines and South Africa].</li>
					<li>About a quarter of the global population is estimated to have been infected with TB bacteria, but most people will not go on to develop TB disease and some will clear the infection. Those who are infected but not (yet) ill with the disease cannot transmit it.</li>
					<li>People infected with TB bacteria have a 5–10% lifetime risk of falling ill with TB. Those with compromised immune systems, such as people living with HIV, malnutrition or diabetes, or people who use tobacco, have a higher risk of falling ill.</li>

            <h1>About TB</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>Tuberculosis (TB) is caused by a bacterium called Mycobacterium tuberculosis.</li>
                <li>TB usually affects the lungs, but can also affect the brain, kidneys, spine, and more.</li>
                <li>TB can affect multiple parts of the body at the same time.</li>
                <li>Two TB-related conditions exist: inactive TB and active TB disease.</li>
                <li>Getting tested and treated for TB protects yourself and your community.</li>

            <h1>Prevention and Diagnosis</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>TB is preventable and curable. If you are at risk for TB, talk with your health care provider. This is the first step to protecting your family, friends, and community from this highly contagious disease.
                </li>
                <li><a href="https://youtu.be/VB7KMHLhqIc?si=0h-80knbm1jwipiv">https://youtu.be/VB7KMHLhqIc?si=0h-80knbm1jwipiv</a></li>
                <li>It is treated by standard 6 month course of 4 antibiotics. Common drugs include rifampicin and isoniazid. In some cases the TB bacteria does not respond to the standard drugs. In this case, the patient has drug-resistant TB. Treatment for drug-resistant TB is longer and more complex. 
                </li>
                <li><b>Stay home:</b> Don't go to work or school.</li>
                <li><b>Isolate at home:</b> Spend as little time as possible among members of your household. Sleep in a separate room.</li>
                <li><b>Ventilate the room:</b> Tuberculosis germs spread more easily in small, closed spaces. If it's not too cold outdoors, open the windows. Use a fan to blow air out. If you have more than one window, use one fan to blow air out and another to blow air in.
                </li>
                <li><b>Face masks:</b> Wear a mask when you have to be around other people. Ask other members of the household to wear masks to protect themselves.</li>
                <li><b>Cover your mouth:</b> Use a tissue to cover your mouth anytime you sneeze or cough. Put the dirty tissue in a bag, seal it and throw it away.</li>
                <li><b>Vaccinations:</b> In countries where tuberculosis is common, infants often are vaccinated with the bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine. This protects infants and toddlers who are more likely to have active TB disease in the fluid surrounding the brain and spinal cord.</li>
                <li><b>Testing for Tuberculosis:</b></li>
				<ol>
					<li>There are two types of tests for tuberculosis (TB) infection: the TB blood test and the TB skin test.</li>
					<li>A positive test result for TB infection means you have TB germs in your body.</li>
					<li>If you test positive for TB infection, your health care provider will do other tests to determine if you have inactive TB (also called latent TB infection) or active TB disease.
					</li>
					<li>A tuberculosis (TB) skin test can tell if you have TB germs in your body.</li>
				</ol>

                <p><b>How diagnosis works:</b></p>
				<ol>
                	<li>Anyone with symptoms of TB disease or a positive TB blood test or TB skin test result should be evaluated by a health care provider for TB disease.</li>
				</ol>
                <p><b>Medical evaluation for TB disease
                </b></p>
				<ol>
					<li>A health care provider may diagnose you with inactive TB or active TB disease based on your:</li>
					<li>Medical history</li>
					<li>Physical examination</li>
					<li>Test for TB infection (TB blood test or TB skin test)</li>
					<li>Chest x-ray</li>
					<li>Laboratory tests to see if TB germs are present (sputum smear and culture)
					</li>
					<li>Laboratory tests for drug resistance</li>
				</ol>
                <p><b>Medical history</b>
                </p>
				<ol>
					<li>A health care provider will ask you questions about your medical history. For example, the health care provider may ask you if you have:</li>
					<li>Symptoms of TB disease
					</li>
					<li>Spent time with someone who has active TB disease
					</li>
					<li>Ever had a positive ⦁	TB blood test or ⦁	TB skin test
					</li>
					<li>Ever been diagnosed with inactive TB or TB disease in the past</li>
					<li>Factors that may increase your risk for becoming infected with TB germs</li>
				</ol>
                <p><b>Physical examination</b>
                </p>
				<ol>
					<li>A physical examination is an essential part of any visit with your health care provider. It can:
					</li>
					<li>Provide valuable information about your overall health</li>
					<li>Help with the diagnosis</li>
					<li>Reveal other factors that might affect TB treatment.
					</li>
				</ol>
